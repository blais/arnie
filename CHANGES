Version 1.2: (minor features release)
-------------------------------------

- Added more tests.

- Added a dry-run option to the archive script.

- Added storing uid and gid in arnie history file, but we're not checking
  changes in those yet.  Adding the values in the file opens up the possibility
  for making those checks in the future.

- Fixed a bug when attempting to back up the root directory / (credits to Uche
  Ogbuji for notifying of the problem).

- Added an option to disregard the MD5 sums for large files (Uche Ogbuji's
  idea).

  log email.
