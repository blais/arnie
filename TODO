Misc Ideas
----------

- Print size of every file added to the backup.
- Support user/group file attributes (and change of).

- Add uid, gid, ctime, mtime, and a flags array to file info.



Slow Operation
--------------

Implement alternate unpacking method, untarring files one on top of the
other and removing unwanted files later.

- Note from Mukund <muks@mukund.org>::

   One minor inconvenience that I do notice is that restore times are
   very very slow (almost unusably slow) when a directory with a large
   number of files such as a Maildir tree are involved. I guess this is
   due to tar archive parsing on a per-file basis through Python's
   library and I remember reading somewhere on your website that you
   were thinking of untarring all of the backup archive in one go and
   then just picking up whatever files one wanted. I'd be grateful if
   you implement this feature.



Tracking new attributes and Storing attributes separately from contents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas from Harry Flink for desired features:

  There are still some features which might be good to add some day:

  1. uid/gid/mode changes shouldn't neccessarily add the whole file,
     if file data (MD5) is not changed, just the file's meta info.

  2. GPG-files should be extracted in fly to avoid making duplicates
     from the backups for extraction. I'm not sure how exactly this
     could be done, but I hope that somehow.

  3. I haven't tested whether modification times are stored and
     restored, but still it would be great to add them in .arniehistory.

  4. Maybe ACL-support someday, but I dont use them currently.
  

For (1) I would use a flag, that tells the restorer to "keep searching backwards
in time" for that one file, but which marks the attributes to be applied after.
This will require some more thinking, maybe all attributes should behave in this
way (i.e. if only mode changes, then no need to store the file again either).

I think the next modification to arnie will be this:  I will add uid, gid,
ctime, mtime and an array of flags to each file info.  This will allow me to
implement future features without having to change the format, and thus to
remain backwards compatible.

cheers,

Testing for uid/gid changes
---------------------------

Testing uid/gid's::

  From Harry Flink:

  > Yes, I noticed that the problem is only in incremental changes.

  Good note.  I will use this to build the tests (I will include a test with sudo).

Compressing Backups
-------------------

Existing backup archives could be joined and compressed at a new date, easily,
by writing a new program which would be a variation on arnie-restore.
